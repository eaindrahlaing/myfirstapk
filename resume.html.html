  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
I am deeply interested in the field of computer science because it combines logical thinking, creativity, and innovation to solve real-world     problems. From a young age, I have been fascinated by how technology works and how it continues to shape the world around us. Computer science, in particular, offers endless possibilities—from developing intelligent systems and applications to improving communication, healthcare, education, and countless other areas of life. I am especially drawn to the way computer science challenges me to think critically and continuously learn, as the field evolves rapidly with new tools, languages, and breakthroughs. Pursuing this interest allows me not only to understand the technical foundations of computing but also to be part of building solutions that can improve people’s lives and make a positive impact on society.
